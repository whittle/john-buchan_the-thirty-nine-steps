My Dear Tommy,

<P CLASS="letter">
You and I have long cherished an affection for that elemental type of
tale which Americans call the 'dime novel' and which we know as the
'shocker'&mdash;the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities, and
march just inside the borders of the possible.  During an illness last
winter I exhausted my store of those aids to cheerfulness, and was
driven to write one for myself.  This little volume is the result, and
I should like to put your name on it in memory of our long friendship,
in the days when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than
the facts.
